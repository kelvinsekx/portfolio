        It's great to meet you. I'm Kelvin, though many online know me as{" "}

        building and scaling high-performing teams, communities, robust mobile
        and web applications. Right now, I do product and engineering management

        Beyond the realm of code, my conversations often orbit around
        engineering, product strategies or passionate commentary on Nigeria. You
        can find my less serious thoughts and banter over on X (formerly
        Twitter).

        I enjoy the rythm of good music and the occasional creative escape with
        oil and acrylic paints. And if you spot someone strolling by in a too
        comfortable, shall we say, "homeless style," there's a good chance it's
        me enjoying a walk.

        Before my coding career, I was into oil and acrylic painting in my early
        undergrad days (2014-2016). I began my programming in final year during
        the ASSU strike (internal to UI). I would use my free time during this
        strike to learn HTML, CSS, and PHP.

        After some time learning PHP, I got introduced into javascript by{" "}

        I fell in love with the animations that comes with it. The rest they say

        Because of my love for econometrics, I spend few time playing with
        python, and how it could be used to enhance econometrics. To me,
        econometrics is the future of economics and its application would mean
        so much for the field.
