        It's great to meet you. I'm Kelvin, though many online know me as{" "}
        <b>Kelvinsekx</b>. For over five years, I've helped businesses thrive by
        building and scaling high-performing teams, communities, robust mobile
        and web applications. Right now, I do product and engineering management

      <p>
        Beyond the realm of code, my conversations often orbit around
        engineering, product strategies or passionate commentary on Nigeria. You
        can find my less serious thoughts and banter over on X (formerly
        Twitter).
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy the rythm of good music and the occasional creative escape with
        oil and acrylic paints. And if you spot someone strolling by in a too
        comfortable, shall we say, "homeless style," there's a good chance it's
        me enjoying a walk.

        My government name is Ukuejubola Kelvin Oritsetimeyin. And while I
        proudly hail from Delta State, Nigeria, Ibadan has been home for most of
        my life. I wear a few hats: developer, product manager, and economist.
        My academic foundation is in Economics and Education (B.sc[Ed]) from the{" "}

        .
      </p>

        Over the past 5 years and counting, I have gained valuable experiences

        , Wigxel Corp, Concrete Communication & OlaOla Poundo Yam. These are
        excluding dozens of short-lived projects. I am a strong advocate for
        open source. I have helped improve a handful of them like
        opensauced.pizza and langcorrect.com.

        My creative sides emerged in my early undergrads years (2014-2016)
        through oil and acrylic painting. My programming journey began just
        after, in my final year, during an Academic Staff Union of Universities
        (ASUU) strike. That unexpected free time became an opportunity to dive
        into HTML, CSS, and PHP.

        A pivotal moment came when{" "}

        </a>{" "}
        introduced me to javascript . The dynamic animations instantly
        captivated me, and as they say, the rest is history!
      </p>
      <p>
        My fascination with econometrics has also led me to explore Python and
        its potential to enhance the field. I genuinely believe econometrics
        holds the key to the future of economics and its practical applications.

        So, there you have it, a deeper look into my background. Those who know
        me well can attest: I'm quite jovial, and there's rarely a dull moment
        around me!
