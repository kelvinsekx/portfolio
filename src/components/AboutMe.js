        I am a Nigerian software engineer, product manager, economist and yabber
        who is popular with the alias Kelvinsekx. I co-founded Ibadan Techies
        Club, a community that organized dozens of tech meetups in Ibadan.
        Presently, I help ambitious company build softwares and teams.

      <CollapsibleSection reverse header={"Early life"}>
        <p>
          Born in Delta State, Nigeria, I moved to Ibadan at age three and have
          lived there since. I am the first of three siblings. My secondary
          education was at Rochas Foundation College, NTC Road, Ibadan, followed
          by my tertiary studies at the University of Ibadan.

          While stories from my childhood suggest I was a talented dancer, this
          particular skill faded as I matured. However, new strengths emerged;
          throughout secondary school, I was known for my exceptional abilities
          with numbers. This innate quantitative aptitude may well have been the
          seed for my later passion for computer science. Before fully immersing
          myself in programming in 2020, I explored my artistic side,
          particularly through drawing and painting, demonstrating an early
          appreciation for both analytical and creative disciplines.

        <p>
          Over the past 5 years, I have gained valuable experiences from working
          with{" "}

          , Wigxel Corp, Concrete Communication & OlaOla Poundo Yam. These are
          excluding dozens of short-lived projects. I am a strong advocate for
          open source. I have helped improve a handful of them like
          opensauced.pizza and langcorrect.com.

          My creative sides emerged in my early undergrads years (2014-2016)
          through oil and acrylic painting. My programming journey began just
          after, in my final year, during an Academic Staff Union of
          Universities (ASUU) strike. That unexpected free time became an
          opportunity to dive into HTML, CSS, and PHP.
        </p>
        <p>
          A pivotal moment came when{" "}

            className="underline"
          >
            Oluwatayo
          </a>{" "}
          introduced me to javascript . The dynamic animations instantly
          captivated me, and as they say, the rest is history!
        </p>
        <p>
          My fascination with econometrics has also led me to explore Python and
          its potential to enhance the field. I genuinely believe econometrics
          holds the key to the future of economics and its practical
          applications.

          So, there you have it, a deeper look into my background. Those who
          know me well can attest: I'm quite jovial, and there's rarely a dull
