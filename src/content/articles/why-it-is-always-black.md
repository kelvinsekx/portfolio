I wear black all the time. A choice that have sparked admiration and criticism alike. In Nigeria, where I live, this have drawn strong opinions, from spiritual warnings to outright dislike. Some have had to walk up to ask why I wear only this color. Many ponder from a distant hoping they can ask someday.

My love for wearing black clothes did not start as a fashion statement. It was born from a scientific and intentional effort. Before I talk about this process. Let me give you a little back story what this choice has cost me.

See some people don't like black, but they don't stop at that. They develop hate for people who wear them all the time too. In Nigeria, this kind of people go a step further. They tell everyone around them why they should fear or hate these people too.

In churches, a lot of spiritual people have dropped messages (serious warning) about how my glory doesn't agree with the black color. People I never talked with or seen before. While these criticisms are loud, you will see my choice to wear black outweighs their concerns.

Before black, I wore grey. Shockingly I got the same taste of perceived concern but not on the level with the black. I could remember vividly how a couple of persons walked up to me with the concern "why only grey?".

I'll highlight how I reached this point.

1. I wear clothes more than once. The color determines if this is possible in the first place. Colors like white and gray can't pass for being worn twice as they reveal stains quickly. The problem that comes with trying to wear twice is the notoriety of stains. Black is obscure.

2. If they scale the first hurdle of being worn twice, washing these colors isn't any easier. I wash myself, trust me when I say it takes an extra skill to wash non black colors well.

3. You may have figured laziness. You are right. Wearing the same kind of clothes and color saves me the headache of "how do I look?", "does it look good?" kind of questions. That is such a huge amount of time saver. Why trade this flexibility?

If wearing black makes me this fierce and feared, why stop? It's an effortless aura. I have heard rumors how my decision must have been influenced by some vuju juju.

On the "it doesn't conform with your glory" threats. If I was a nepo baby with inherited blinding glory, this wouldn't have hold water. you can't blame me if the glory doesn't blind yet. It's not one color that will change it either.
