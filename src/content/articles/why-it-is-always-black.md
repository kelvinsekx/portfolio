I wear black all the time. A choice that have sparked admiration and criticism alike. In Nigeria, where I live, this have drawn strong opinions, from spiritual warnings to outright dislike. Some have had to asked why I wear only this color. Many ponder from a distant hoping they can ask someday.

My love for wearing black clothes did not start as a fashion statement. It was born from a scientific and intentional effort and process. Before I talk about this process. Let me give you a little back story what this choice has cost me.

See some people don't like black, but they don't stop at that. They develop hate for people who wear them all the time too. In Nigeria, this kind of people go a step further. They tell everyone around them why they should fear or hate them too.

In churches, a lot of spiritual people have dropped messages (serious warning) about how my glory doesn't agree with the black color. I mean people I never talked with or seen before. While these criticisms are loud, my choice to wear black that outweigh their concerns.For example, if I wasn't always wearing black would as many of them tell me this? Plus whenever I ask this people to help me afford new color,s none have offered to give me money to buy them.

Before black, I wore grey only. Shockingly I got the same taste of perceived concern but not on the level of black. For example, I remember vividly a couple of persons walked up to me asking why I wear only grey round necks.

1. I wear clothes more than once. The color determines if this is possible in the first place. White o gray can't pass for being worn twice as they reveal stains quickly. The drama that comes with trying to wear twice is the notoriety of stains. Black is obscure.

2. If they scale the first hurdle of being worn twice, washing these colors isn't any easier. I wash myself, trust me when I say it takes an extra skill to wash non black colors well.

3. You may figured laziness too. Wearing the same kind of clothes and color saves me the headache of "how do I look?", "does it look good?" kind of questions. That is such a huge amount of time saver. Why trade this flexibility?

If just wearing black makes me this fierce and feared, why stop? It's an effortless aura. Also for some people who thinks there is some vuju juju to it. Then why am I yet to figure out having a money? Do they even think about this.

On the "it doesn't conform with your glory". I'll prove you wrong. If I was a nepo baby I would have inherited a blinding glory anyways, you can't blame me if the glory doesn't blind. It's not one color that will change it or mar it.

Until they mean it enough afford the change, I will stick to choices that fit my lifestyle.
