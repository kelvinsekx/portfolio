## Hello,

It's indeed a new beginning. 4 years after my last post, and here I am again reviving blogging.

I have changed a lot, at least I am sure of physically and it is the same for every area of my life. In that liue, I expect my mission for this blog to change too.

My goal for this post is to point to the new direction of this effort which is highlighted below:

- Posts are personal

  Unlike previous posts that were jamborees of code, personal stories and learning endeavors, the posts here will shift to documenting life lessons, struggles and wisdom. Many will be political, geopolitical or just my point of view to numerous opinions on the internet.

- Posts are an archive of beliefs that may change or not

  Nigeria Twitter has progressively turned uncultured and unsafe to document beliefs or personal facts. I hope this place gently replaces it for a long time so that my Twitter focuses just on Tech and the future of Africa perhaps.

Thank you for joining me in this new journey.
