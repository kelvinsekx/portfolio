## Hello,

It's indeed a new beginning. 4 years after my last post, and here I am again reviving blogging.

I have changed a lot, at least I am sure of physically and it is the same for every areas of my life. In that lue, I expect my mission for this blog to change too.

My goal for this post is to point to the new direction of this effort which are highlighted below:

- Posts are personal

  Unlike previous posts that were jambories of code, personal stories and learning endeavors, the posts here will shift to documenting life lessons, struggles and wisdom. Many will be political, geo or just my point of view to opinions on the internet.

- Posts are an achive of believes that may change or not

  Nigeria Twitter has progressively turned uncultured and unsafe to document believes or personal facts. I hope this place gentle replaces it for a long time so that my Twitter focuses just on Tech and the future of Africa perhaps.

Thank you for joining me in this new journey.
