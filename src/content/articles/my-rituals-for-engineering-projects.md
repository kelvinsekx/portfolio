This is a frequently updated post where I help myself by documenting rituals to be followed when setting up projects I am handling.

## Next Projects

### Create a new Next.js App

```bash
npx next-create-app
```

### Install Ultracite

If I am not the only one building the project

```bash
npx ultracite init
```

### Initialize Shadcn UI

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

### Add all shadcn components

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add -all
```
